    <p>Over the years, technology has revolutionized our world and daily lives. Technology has created amazing tools and resources, putting useful information at our fingertips.</p> 
    <p>Modern technology has paved the way for multi-functional devices like the smartwatch and the smartphone. Computers are increasingly faster, more portable, and higher-powered than ever before. With all of these revolutions, technology has also made our lives easier, faster, better, and more fun.</p><br>
    <img style="opacity:1;" src="images/tech1.jpg" ><br><br>
    <p>In this article, we’ll cover how technology has impacted senior’s lives in and out of the home. Technology’s advancements have provided quicker ways to communicate through instant messaging apps and social media platforms. Seniors are able to keep in touch with loved ones, while caregivers have new avenues to check in on aging parents or patients.</p>
   <p>Technology has also given us brand new devices in recent decades, like smartwatches, tablets, and voice assistant devices. With these devices, we can do things like transfer money instantly and make purchases for everything from clothes, food delivery, groceries, furniture, and more. Technology has changed how we entertain ourselves, meet each other, and consume all types of media. It’s made fun advancements, but it’s also made important advancements in safety when it comes to home security and medical devices.</p>                   <p>Especially for seniors, these devices are providing the freedom to age in place, to live independently, and to continue moving through everyday life with peace of mind. It opens up new opportunities by helping with safety, mobility and connectivity. Medical advancements have made it so you can stay proactive with conditions like diabetes and arthritis. With new medical alert devices, seniors can also get help at the push of a button and keep in touch with loved ones no matter where they are in the world.</p>
   <p>Since there are so many new technologies to keep track of, it can seem overwhelming to adapt. However, all of these new technologies are designed to make your life easier. Even though it may not feel intuitive, learning how to use smart phones, smartwatches and voice assistants just takes a little bit of instruction and practice.</p>  
    <p>When it comes to the way we communicate overall, modern technology has had a powerful influence.</p>       <p>Digital technology has changed what people term as “media.” The influence of new technology on media is apparent since a media company isn’t necessarily a news platform anymore. A media company is now any company that helps pass information across the globe, including social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter.</p>
    <p><a style="text-decoration: underline;color: blue;">The amount of active web users globally is now near 3.2 billion people.</a> That is almost half of the world’s population. Every day, two million smartphones are sold around the world, and the amount of information we share shared on social media networks is phenomenal.</p>

    <p>Social media isn’t the only big statement digital technology has made. Neither is social media the only way technology has had an impact in everyone’s life.</p>
    <p>Before mobile technology, you had to search through a dictionary to understand the meaning of a word. Now you can look words up in a dictionary app or quickly search the Internet. Beyond words, you can search for practically anything on the Internet using search engines like Google and Bing.</p>

    <p>There is no denying that the future of technology will continue to revolutionize our lives. In a few years, driverless cars may be the norm for everyone, and robots will be commonplace in factories. Future technology is sure to transform our lives in unbelievable ways, but here we  highlight the many common ways technology is changing our lives today.</p>

  <h4 style="color:darkslategray; font-family: cursive; font-size: 22px;">World Records – Why do Athletes Keep Breaking Them?</h4>
     <br>
     <p>Over 30 world records were broken during the London 2012 Summer Olympics.  They fell in swimming, cycling, running, weightlifting and a number of other sports.  But how do athletes continue to get better, jump longer, run or swim faster. Although scientists say that athletes have reached their limits records continue to fall. In almost every sport athletes have become better since the Olympic movement began.</p>
     <img src="images/sport2.jpg">
<p>One reason is that more and more people than ever before have access to sports and exercise. They start at an earlier age and can compete longer in their sport. In schools more and more natural talents can be discovered.</p>
     <p>Another reason is that athletes can train harder and, as professionals, concentrate wholly on their sport instead of rushing to a training session after their day job. As medicine improves, athletes can stay in competition for a longer time and overcome injuries faster. Many top athletes achieve their best results later on in their careers. Technology has also helped improve scores. Through video analysis, for example, coaches can concentrate on fine-tuning an athlete’s technique. Material and equipment is constantly getting better.</p>
<p>One of the most important factors, however, is the human mind. It lies in our nature to be better and faster than someone else. The will to break a barrier can release immense power in your body.</p>
<p>So, where are the limits? One of the most difficult questions to answer is how fast a human being can run.  Some decades ago, nobody thought a person could ever run under 10 seconds in the 100 meter dash. But the record was broken at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics. At the moment Usain Bolt is the fastest man on Earth at 9.58 seconds. Scientists say that 9.48 may be the absolute limit for running such a distance, but, who knows, maybe some runner will one day run under 9 seconds.</p>
